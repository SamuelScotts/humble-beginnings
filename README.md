# Humble Beginnings...

Initial commit of the beginnings of project.  Basic template built using:

https://weichie.com/blog/setting-up-vue-projects-with-vue-cli-vuex-routing-and-firebase/

Great tutorial that's well structured and laid out.  Helped create a strong initial structure for the coming project.

The project is full-stack template, build with JavaScript, that uses Firebase Authentication and a Cloud Firestore DB on the backend, while running Vue.js, Vuex, VueRouting and Vuetify on the front. Build to help consolidate learning round Google's Firebase platform.
